# Car Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting vehicle demand for an official dealership using Machine Learning. By forecasting sales trends, the model aims to optimize inventory management, reduce holding costs, and align acquisition strategies with market demand.

## Key Features
- **Time Series Analysis:** Historical sales data processing and seasonality detection.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) / [XGBoost] models to forecast monthly demand.
- **Business Logic:** Integration of **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** and **LTV (Lifetime Value)** insights to prioritize high-value vehicle categories.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive dashboards showing demand trends and stock recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colab.

## Business Impact
By accurately predicting demand, the dealership can:
1. **Lower CAC:** Allocating marketing budget only to models with high predicted turnover.
2. **Maximize LTV:** Ensuring stock availability for high-margin customer segments.
3. **Inventory Efficiency:** Reducing the gap between supply and actual market needs.
